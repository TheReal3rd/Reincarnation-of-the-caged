    scene image "bg loststory1.jpg"
    "In a lush and verdant land, two sisters hunt for their daily meals, ebon hair
    streaming behind them as they dash through the forest."

    "One day, as the elder sister is going about her usual routine, she hears her
    sister scream. Rushing to the sound, she finds the girl frozen in fear with
    a beast ready to attack."
    "A single arrow from the woman's bow drives the creature
    away, causing the younger to spill tears of relief."
    "After embracing the girl,
    the woman quickly offers up her silver hairpin, a keepsake of their mother her
    younger sister has long desired. As her tears dry, the girls swears she will be
    the one to do the protecting next time."

    scene image "bg losttitle2.jpg"
    "Second part"
    "Their hunting complete, the sisters make for home. But when they exit the forest,
    they see smoke and flame rising in the distance."
    "The woman immediately thinks of
    the war that is raging in a neighboring nation, and after telling her sister to
    stay put, makes her way to town."

    scene image "bg loststory3.jpg"
    "When she arrives, she finds herself surrounded by the incessant crackle of flames.
    The town is a slaughterhouse, with corpses on every corner."
    "As she takes in the scene, her younger sister suddenly rushes up to her."
    "She immediately grabs her
    and attempts to flee, but they are quickly surrounded by enemy soldiers and cut
    down. As her consciousness fades away, she hears her sister scream, followed by
    the voice of a soldier uttering two words:"

    "Sort them."

    "Third part"

    "bg loststory4.png"
    "Thinking that she heard her sister, the woman opens her eyes and finds herself in
    a prison. Her body is now a stranger—one arm and one leg have been replaced by
    mechanical substitutes, and her ebon hair has turned white as new-fallen snow."

    "After breaking out of her cell, she dispatches a guard with ease. He cackles as
    he dies, gleefully informing her that the captives in this place are all sorted,
    experimented on, and turned into killing machines. He then tells her that she is
    one of the failures."

    "Her mind is filled with a single thought: Is my sister safe? She dashes
    from the prison, running faster and faster in an attempt to escape the terrible
    thoughts in her head and feeling in her chest."

    scene image "bg losttitle4.jpg"
    "Finale"

    "bg loststory5.png"
    "When the woman exits the prison, she finds herself in a strange land of flames
    and blood. As she picks her way through the battlefield, she hears a child's
    voice and begins to run."
    "Suddenly, the owner of the voice appears before her; it
    is her sister, twisted and warped as a result of the sorting."
    "The girl makes a sound—a desperate, terrible hiss that might be the woman's name—then chokes
    on her own blood as a soldier cuts her down like an animal.
    After this, her memory goes mercifully blank."

    "When she comes to, she finds the cold corpse of her sister surrounded by chunks
    of what used to be enemy soldiers. She gently embraces the girl and closes
    her eyes. From this day onward, revenge would be her only reason to live."
    scene image "blackscreen.jpg"
    "What was lost, completed."

    scene image "marionette1.png"
    "I was too much used to this feeling I had no name for, shattered memory data fragment."
    #-insert title screen here Determined hearts, the clockwork Man-
    "Deep beneath a castle, a mechanical soldier sits amidst the detritus of a
    storehouse. One day, a boy is brought to the room by soldiers and tossed to the
    floor."
    "As he stares at the boy, the man begins collecting junk to make
    a bed; when he is finished, the two sit upon it and tell each other their tales."

    "The name the man gives is that of the first model of machine soldiers. He explains
    how he was unable to carry out orders and therefore discarded as defective."

    "The name the boy gives is that of the kingdom's firstborn prince. After explaining
    how he has been cast aside because of his disease, the boy gives a wry smile at
    the similar circumstances they find themselves in."
    #-insert title screen, his song.-
    "The boy's condition worsens within the poor conditions of the storehouse, so the
    man searches around and finds a medicine bottle. But the bottle is empty, which
    causes the boy to chuckle."
    "The man's concern gives him newfound energy,
    however, so he places a candle in the bottle and turns it into a small lamp."

    "In the soft glow of the lamp, the boy sings the tale of a hero who challenges
    evil in order to save his people."
    "As he listens to the beautiful melody, the man
    feels something change in his chest, and words of gratitude begin to spill from
    his lips—words clockwork men like him should not be able to say. Upon hearing
    this, a joyful smile spreads across the face of the boy."

    scene image "marionette2.png"
    #-insert screen, To Face a Father-
    "They hear soldiers gossiping on the other side of the door; the start of another
    war is upon them. The boy looks at the man and begins passionately speaking of
    his resolve to stop the war for the sake of his people."
    "After a moment's thought, the man breaks down the door of the prison, beats back the guards,
    and accompanies the boy to the throne room."

    "Standing before the king like the bold hero of his song, the boy demands that
    the war be ended. But the king deems this act to be treason and orders his own
    son killed. The clockwork man cannot disobey his king's orders, and slowly aims
    his gun."
    "But then he summons forth something new—a will of his own—and
    manages to defy the command. As soldiers rush into the room, the man seizes
    the boy's hand and flees the castle with his new charge in tow."
    "The pair runs through the village outside the castle with royal guards
    in pursuit."
    #-insert screen, The night it all began-
    "Though the villagers are in uproar over the impending war,
    they soon realize the boy is royalty and begin jeering at him, heaping their
    outrage against the monarchy on his head alone."
    "But despite the words, fists,
    and more being hurled in their direction, the pair never stops running."

    "Finally, impossibly, they escape. As they look back on their former home,
    the boy swears to put an end to the war his father started."
    "Upon hearing this,
    the clockwork man makes his own oath to guard the prince until his dying breath.
    With determination in their hearts, they take their first steps on the long and
    winding road to peace."

    "Determined hearts, the end."

    scene image "fleeting1.png"

    "In the darkness, the woman quietly listens to her master speak. He is a feudal
    lord, one to whom she has pledged fidelity. He praises her for her previous
    assassination, and commands her to move on to the next. From beyond the wall,
    she utters a single word:"

    "Understood."

    "As she walks through town, she is surrounded by the excited hum of life
    and the smiles of random people."
    "These are things she can never know,
    and while she envies them, she usually pays them no mind—for she walks
    a different path, one set in a darkness illuminated only by the glinting
    of blades."
    "Today, however, the bright smile of a child she passes refuses to
    leave her mind. Even as she cuts down bandits on the road, the young one's
    carefree expression stays with her."

    "She recalls her days of training—training much too severe for a child.
    Every morning, she would ignore the pain of her exhausted body and bring herself
    to the flogging garden, where the adults would berate her for lateness
    and whip her."
    "She was instructed to be always at her lord's side, and to serve
    him as a tool for eliminating his enemies. This had been the way of her family
    for time immemorial, and as one of them, she was burdened with the assassin's
    duty before she was even born."

    "But these are poor memories, and as she slips into the rainy forest, she banishes
    them from her mind."
    "Complaining will help nothing; all that matters is the mission.
    With her resolve restored, she kills a guard at the gate and enters the castle that looms before her."

    "Her target is the heir to an enemy territory. Killing this target within
    the supposed safety of the castle will cause panic, at which point she will
    to signal her lord's army to begin an all-out attack."

    "As she flies down the corridor and into the reception room, she discovers her
    target to be a small boy."
    "But even when she presses the tip of her sword to the
    childs throat, he does not cry out. After studying his face for a moment,
    she realizes the child is not a boy at all, but a girl."
    "When asked about her disguise, the girl replies"
    "'I wish this house would fall. I am naught but a puppet
    who dances at my fathers tune. I'm no child to him—merely a tool to be used.'"
    scene image "fleeting2.png"
    "This resentment carries a familiar ring for the woman, who suddenly sees her
    younger self in the face and fate of the girl who waits before her."
    "As she struggles with her decision, the roar of the rain outside fades to a
    distant whisper in her ears."

    "After an uncountable amount of time, woman sheathes her blade and asks"
    akeha "Did you mean it when you said you wish your house would fall?"
    "The girl nods, shaking from the strain of the moment, and the woman responds with a single
    word once more:"

    "Understood."

    "Behind her, soldiers suddenly burst into the room. Minutes later, they all
    lie dead on the floor—but the woman has sustained a fatal wound in the process."

    "She does not know why she has done this, save that she understands what it is
    like to suffer for the sake of one's family, but she does not regret her actions."
    "And though she knows saving one person is not enough to grant absolution,
    she figures it will make a nice gift to take with her into hell."

    scene image "mountain1.png"

    "A man makes his way along a mountain path buried in snow.
    There is no movement. No sound. Only a perfect wall of unbroken white.
    Though the sun is starting to set, the man's pace does not falter."
    "When he encounters a crevice, he cuts down a tree to make a bridge. When the moon
    rises high in the sky, his footsteps do not slow."
    "This mountain holds a wondrous
    charm for him, and no matter how dangerous it may be in the dark, he has absolute
    trust in his experience. Even when he finds himself surrounded by starving wolves,
    that trust does not waiver."

    "The man knows this to be a most precipitous mountain, one where no person has
    ever reached the summit. But he is an adventurer who has conquered many peaks
    in the past, and he eternally seeks the line between life and death within
    the harshest environments."
    "This pursuit is his entire reason for living."

    "A blizzard sets in over the snowy mountain, as though attempting to refuse
    the man passage. The freezing wind and snow sting him, making his steps heavy.
    Finally, he catches glimpse of a small cave in the rocks and takes shelter from
    the elements."
    "Once inside, he recalls the letter in his pocket. His daughter had
    given it to him before his climb, along with a charm. The thought of his daughter
    gives him renewed strength, and when the blizzard subsides,
    he begins his climb anew."

    "Halfway up the mountain, he comes across a lake with a corpse lying on its shore.
    There is no way to tell how long it has been there, but when he investigates
    the body, he finds a note in the pocket."
    "The handwriting is shaky—perhaps from
    the cold, perhaps from grief—and it tells of the corpse's regret at having left
    his family behind to attempt the climb."

    "A tremendous cliff looms before the man—the final trial before the peak.
    If he can conquer this, the mountain will be his. He whispers encouraging words
    to himself, and though death lurks with every handhold and footfall, he finally
    reaches the top."

    "Though the mountain has supposedly never been climbed, he finds a ruined shrine
    waiting for him. He does not know how long it has been here or how old it is,
    but the sight of it stirs his adventurer's blood. But when he sets foot inside,
    he finds, impossibly, that his wife is waiting for him."

    "The baby is coming. she says, her words an echo in his mind.
    Why did you leave us?"

    "He rubs at his eyes fiercely, and when he reopens them, he sees not his wife,
    but the frozen corpse of a pregnant woman holding an all-too-familiar charm.
    The sight solidifies his resolution to return home to his family, and he turns
    and departs without a second thought."

    "A lonely house sits in a forest of deep snow. As a pregnant woman minds the
    housework, a knock shudders the door, a small girl responds"
    "Its Dad! -cries the womans daughter.
    as she leaps toward the door. But when she flings it open, the stoop is bare.
    A trick of the wind, perhaps."
    scene image "mountain2.png"
    "The two of them wait for the man to return home. They talk of how sad they are
    not to be with him, what they will do when he returns, and how their family is
    soon to be one member larger."
    "Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by
    the woman clutching her stomach in pain; the new life they were just speaking
    of is ready to be brought into the world."

    "The man awakens in the darkness to find himself lying at the bottom of the cliff
    just before the peak. I am already gone, he realizes with something
    approaching wonder."
    "He never conquered the cliff, never saw a shrine; it was
    nothing but a fragment of a dream after he fell. Though he can no longer feel
    his fingers, he fumbles in his pocket to pull out the charm from his daughter.
    And with its faint warmth moving through his body, he slowly closes his eyes."
