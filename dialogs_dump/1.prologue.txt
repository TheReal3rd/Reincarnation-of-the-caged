Massive stone towers pierce an empty sky.

This enormous structure is called The Cage.

In its shadow, a lone girl walks with purpose...

And she will not leave until she has what she desires.

Mama *char

Well! Look who's finally up.

Oh dear. So you did lose your voice after all.

*opt Give up and stay silent.
*opt Try to say something.
Don't worry. Mama's here to help.

This way.

You've lost more than just your voice.
But I'm sure you already know that, don't you?

You've lost so much. But the time has come to reclaim it.

Life will be much harder if you can't speak, after all.

These stairs are the entrance to your prisonâ€”a place known as "The Cage."
