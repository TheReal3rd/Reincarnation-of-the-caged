Mama *char

You have a long road ahead of you, so you'll need to increase your power.

Hmm, where should I start? First, you need to arrange your allies in a loadout...

Actually, it would be much easier to explain in a demonstration.

It's mostly the same as any other game.

The road splits here. Mama thinks we should go right because it's the RIGHT way!

Hmm... But left also might be the right way.

If it wasn't clear by now, Mama doesn't actually know.

Oh, this weapon is...

Anyway! Let's get started on its restoration, shall we? I wonder what kind of story we'll find this time.

What Was Lost
Their Verdant Home

Storyman *char

Once, two sisters with lovely ebon hair lived in a lush and verdant land.

They hunted for food in the forest, and did their best to each support the other.

Little Sister *char

Hey Sis, guess what!?

Today, I'm gonna hunt for our food all by myself!

Storyman *char

The elder sister had been born in the woods, and was an archer of rare skill.

When their parents died, she began teaching the younger how to hunt.

The younger looks up to her, and wants so badly to test out her new skills.

This thought fills the older sister with warmth as she follows after her sibling.

Little Sister *char

Here goes...

??? *char

ROAAAR!

Storyman *char

Suddenly, the elder sibling hears a beast cry out from the direction of her little sister.

She sets off after her at a frantic pace.

The savage beast looms over the prone girl and makes to attack.

As an arrow penetrates the beast's tender flesh, it turns tail and flees.

There was no way her little sister could have taken down the massive creature alone.

Little Sister *char

I was so scared, Sis!

Storyman *char

Trying to calm her, the woman removes her silver hairpin and places it on her sister.

It is a keepsake of their mother, one the young girl has long desired.

"Thanks, Sis," she says, beaming. "Next time, it'll be my turn to protect you!"

Mama *char

Ah, yes. I see. The story of this weapon is all about that woman.

I feel like we've seen her somewhere before...

What could this black barrier be?

How can the enemy be acting outside of the scarecrows?

Well, let's just square them away as best we can as we go forward, okay?

What on earth could those dark creatures be after?

I'm sorry, child. There are just so many things that Mama doesn't know.

Look. Something's out there.

What could it be?

There are so many mysteries in The Cage, aren't there?

This second scarecrow will hold another part of the weapon's memory.

What Was Lost
A Sister's Love

Storyman *char

Done with their hunting, the black-haired sisters decide to return home before dusk.

The younger has caught a small bunny, and the elder a large boar.

It was a typical day of hunting for the pair.

They only notice the disaster when they come to the bill that overlooks the town.

Flames billow forth, and the chilling snaps of distant gunfire can be heard.

The woman immediately thinks of the war that is raging in the neighboring nation.

She tells her sister to stay put and goes to see what has happened for herself.

Little Sister *char

Be careful...

Storyman *char

The town is oddly still save for the incessant crackle of flames.

The woman gasps as she takes in the grisly sight before her.

All she can see are bodies. Bodies. Bodies.

Royal Soldier *char

Over here! A survivor!

Storyman *char

After defeating the soldier, she hears a voice.

Her worried sister has followed her into the fires of the village.

Enemy soldiers cry out all around them.

Royal Soldier *char

Seize them!

There's two of 'em!

For the kingdom!

Little Sister *char

Sis, we have to run!

Storyman *char

As the woman feared, the war from the nearby nation has finally found them.

Strange and fearsome men surround them on all sides.

Impact. Heat. Pain. ...Her little sister's screams.

As the woman's consciousness flickers out, two words from a soldier reach her ears:

"Sort them."

Mama *char

I see. This weapon speaks of war.

I suppose it's rare for the memories in these weapons to be peaceful ones.

That's a little sad.

This room is a bit strange, isn't it?

Can you see down there?

There are so many paths going every which way. It's like a maze.

I wonder where the other paths lead.

What Was Lost
They Will Be Sorted

Storyman *char

The black-haired woman regains consciousness in a world enveloped by haze.

She hears a faint voice.

??? *char

PlEaSe... heLP mE...

Storyman *char

It sounds similar to her little sister's voice, but also...different. Wrong.

My sister. I have to save my sister.

The woman's dim memories slowly become clear.

The blow she'd taken. Her sister screaming. The soldiers' words.

Her only sister. Her only family. She must save her.

As she runs, the woman's world is enveloped in a shimmering wall of white.

When the woman wakes anew, she is lying on the floor of an unfamiliar prison.

Something is terribly wrong.

She looks down at her body and stifles a gasp.

One arm and one leg have been replaced by mechanical substitutes...

And her black hair is now as white as snow.

Where is my sister!?

She dashes off through the dim prison in search of her missing sibling.

She dispatches both her cell door and its guard with equal ease.

Only then does she realize the truth: Her body is now a terrible weapon.

As this knowledge sinks in, darkness envelops her...

When she interrogates the dying guard about her sister, he grins madly and says,

"Our kingdom will invade all! Every country will bend the knee to our might!"

"Then we'll experiment on the survivors and turn them into beautiful killing machines!"

Oh yes. They will be sorted.

Royal Soldier *char

You were...a failure....

Storyman *char

With these final words, the soldier dies.

The woman begins to run.

Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

She repeats the mantra as she runs, praying that somehow her sister has escaped this fate...

Mama *char

The memories of the woman in this weapon...

She lost her arm and leg because of her dark past.

Wh-what!?

Monster *char

--!

..... 

Mama *char

That was...

Looks like that monster ran off somewhere.

Anyway, the next memory we find will be the last for this part of The Cage.

We're almost there, child. Just keep going.

What Was Lost
The Fires of Her Revenge

Storyman *char

As the woman exits her prison, she beholds a town stained red with both flame and blood.

She is in a strange land; one she does not recognize.

But she must find her sister.

The woman runs. And runs. And runs.

Royal Soldier *char

Hey! HEY! One of the failures has escaped!

??? *char

Waaaaaah!

Storyman *char

That's a child!

Upon hearing the wail, she dashes toward the sound.

??? *char

Kya ha ha ha ha!

HEE HEE HEE. WHAT FUN. WHAT FUN.

Storyman *char

The thing standing before her was once her sister.

But now, all trace of her former self has been lost to the sorting.

Little Sister *char

HEE HEE! KILL!! KILL! I WANT TO KIIIIILL!

SssIIIsterrRRRr...

Storyman *char

Her transformed little sister trembles, as if trying to remember something.

Royal Soldier *char

I've got eyes on two failures!

Storyman *char

The moment her sister is cut down in front of her, the woman loses all control.

Even when her enemies are no more than mangled hunks of flesh, she cannot stop.

Finally, the woman cradles her sister in her arms and gazes at her blood-stained face.

Their hair, once dark as night itself, was now pure white.

Yet the hairpin still glinted from atop the sister's head.

The woman was alone. Her fate was sealed. And so she swore a vow to her sister.

The fires of her revenge would rage until they consumed the entire kingdom.

Mama *char

People need goals and hopes in order to live their lives.

And for her, revenge was itself a form of hope.

Hope: The spirit of desire and the drive to move forward.

There are still many things you need to reclaim.

Come now. The next fragment is waiting for you
